# Feed Forward Neural Network

A [Feed Forward Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), in the following simply referred to as _ANN_, is the most basic form of an Artificial Neural Network, which propagates values through layers of neurons and is being trained by propagating an error value back through the network using a method called back-propagation.

To use it, you must use the `tf.FeedForward.Network` namespace.
